# Introduction
Raw data are obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository. In particular we used the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set [1], that was used by the original collectors to conduct experiments exploiting Support Vector Machine (SVM) [2].
Activity Recognition (AR) aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions [3]. The collectors used a sensor based approach employing smartphones as sensing tools. Smartphones are an effective solution for AR, because they come with embedded built-in sensors such as microphones, dual cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.
The data set was built from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually [4].
The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The script run_analysis.Rperforms the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

# Address the vriables
First, all the similar data is merged using the rbind() function. By similar, we address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from activity_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.
On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.

# Generate the Dataset
Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded to this repository.
Variables
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in mean_and_std_features, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.
all_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a big dataset.
Finally, averages_data contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.
